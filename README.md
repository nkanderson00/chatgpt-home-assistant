you can use vosk (stt.py) or openai-whisper (stt_whisper.py) which is default. Start the server in server/main.py which runs whisper. Use a powerful machine for this. Then run Assistant.py.

Be sure to set your token in gpt.py and your microphone name when creating the Recognizer class.


I will make this prettier in the future. This is still a WIP.
